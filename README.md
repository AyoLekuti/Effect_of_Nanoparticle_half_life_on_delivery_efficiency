# Effect_of_Nanoparticle_half_life_on_delivery_efficiency

Repository for all code regarding the paper "The effect of nanoparticle half-life on tumour delivery efficiency".

The Constrained model python file:
- calculates half-life from experimental data using the two-compartment model.
- the model constrains the y0 (%ID/g) = 100,
-   based on the assumption at t = 0 mins, 100% of the injected dose is in the blood.

All python processing was performed in an Anaconda environment.
